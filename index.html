			<h3>Hi there! My name is Chloe Hang and I am a second year Business Technology Management student at Wilfrid Laurier University.</h3>

			<p>As of last May, I have worked for Recruitment and Admissions as a Student Ambassador where I give tours of the Brantford campus to prospective students and their families. I am also a part of my program’s Student Association where my role as Event Coordinator is to plan events that bring students in our program together.</p>

			<p>In the past, I have taken on many professional roles as well as balanced out the work with some leisure. I have enjoyed every DECA competition that I attended while I was in high school, and also all the sports teams I played for whether it was Ultimate Frisbee or Womens’ Powderpuff Flag Football. I love to get involved wherever I can and dedicate my time to activities that I am passionate about.</p>

			<p>Feel free to email me or contact me through any of the links below!</p>
